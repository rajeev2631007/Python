Sure, here is a script for AWS that achieves the same task using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). The script starts an EC2 instance and schedules it to stop at a specific time in the Indian Standard Time (IST) timezone.

import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Set variables
aws_access_key_id = 'your_aws_access_key_id'
aws_secret_access_key = 'your_aws_secret_access_key'
region = 'your_aws_region'
instance_id = 'your_instance_id'

# Connect to AWS
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id,
    aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key,
    region_name=region
)
ec2 = session.resource('ec2')

# Start the instance
instance = ec2.Instance(instance_id)
instance.start()

# Schedule the instance to stop at a specific time
# The schedule time is set to 2 hours from the current time in IST timezone
schedule_time = datetime.now(tz=None) + timedelta(hours=2)
schedule_time_str = schedule_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')  # Format the schedule time as required by AWS (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)

# Stop the instance at the scheduled time
response = ec2.meta.client.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id], ScheduledStopTime=schedule_time_str)


Explanation of the code:

    Import the necessary Boto3 modules.
    Set the AWS access key ID, secret access key, region, and instance ID as variables.
    Connect to the AWS account using the provided access key ID and secret access key.
    Start the EC2 instance using the start_instances method.
    Calculate the schedule time by adding 2 hours to the current time in the IST timezone.
    Format the schedule time as a string in the required format for AWS (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).
    Stop the EC2 instance at the scheduled time using the stop_instances method.

Note: The schedule time is set to 2 hours from the current time for testing purposes. You can adjust the schedule time as per your requirement.

To schedule the script to run at a specific time, you can use AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events. Here are the steps to schedule the script:

    Create a new Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
    Upload the Python script as a deployment package.
    Set the Lambda function handler to lambda_function.lambda_handler.
    Create a new CloudWatch Events rule to trigger the Lambda function at a specific time.
    Set the time zone to IST (UTC+05:30) while creating the CloudWatch Events rule.

The CloudWatch Events rule will trigger the Lambda function at the specified time, which will start the EC2 instance and schedule it to stop at a specific time.
