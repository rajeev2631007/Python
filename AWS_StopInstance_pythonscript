Sure, here is a script for AWS using Python boto3 library. The script will start an EC2 instance and schedule it to stop at a specific time. The schedule time is set in Indian Standard Time (IST).


import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Set variables
aws_access_key_id = 'your_aws_access_key_id'
aws_secret_access_key = 'your_aws_secret_access_key'
region = 'your_aws_region'
instance_id = 'your_instance_id'

# Connect to AWS
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key, region_name=region)

# Start the instance
response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])

# Schedule the instance to stop at a specific time
# The schedule time is set in Indian Standard Time (IST)
schedule_time = datetime.now(tz=None) + timedelta(hours=2)  # Schedule to stop the instance in 2 hours
schedule_time_str = schedule_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')  # Format the schedule time as required by AWS

# Stop the instance at the scheduled time
response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id], ScheduledStopTime=schedule_time_str)




Explanation of the code:

    Import the necessary boto3 library.
    Set the AWS access key ID, secret access key, region, and instance ID as variables.
    Connect to the AWS account using the provided access key ID and secret access key.
    Start the EC2 instance using the start_instances method.
    Calculate the schedule time by adding 2 hours to the current time.
    Format the schedule time as a string in the required format for AWS (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).
    Stop the EC2 instance at the scheduled time using the stop_instances method.

Note: The schedule time is set to 2 hours from the current time for testing purposes. You can adjust the schedule time as per your requirement.

To schedule the script to run at a specific time, you can use AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events. Here are the steps to schedule the script:

    Create a new Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
    Upload the Python script as a deployment package.
    Set the Lambda function handler to lambda_function.lambda_handler.
    Create a new CloudWatch Events rule to trigger the Lambda function at a specific time.
    Set the time zone to IST (UTC+05:30) while creating the CloudWatch Events rule.

The CloudWatch Events rule will trigger the Lambda function at the specified time, which will start the EC2 instance and schedule it to stop at a specific time.
